The mr(1) command can checkout, update, or perform other actions on a set
of repositories as if they were one combined respository. It supports any
combination of subversion, git, cvs, mercurial, bzr, darcs, cvs, vcsh,
fossil and veracity repositories, and support for other revision control
systems can easily be added. (There are extensions adding support for
unison and git-svn.)

It is extremely configurable via simple shell scripting. Some examples
of things it can do include:

* Update a repository no more frequently than once every twelve hours.
* Run an arbitrary command before committing to a repository.
* When updating a git repository, pull from two different upstreams
  and merge the two together.
* Run several repository updates in parallel, greatly speeding up
  the update process.
* Remember actions that failed due to a laptop being offline, so they
  can be retried when it comes back online.

## Get mr

mr is available in git at `git://git.kitenet.net/mr`, or
[in gitweb](http://git.kitenet.net/?p=mr.git). It's in all recent versions
of Debian. If you want a tarball, the best place to get one is from
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/mr>. Unofficial RPMs are
provided by [Douglas E. Warner](http://www.silfreed.net/download/repo/packages/mr/).
It's also in Mac Homebrew.

## Discuss mr

The [VCS-Home](http://vcs-home.madduck.net/) group has a mailing list that
is probably the best place to discuss mr.

Bugs should be filed to the [Debian BTS](http://bugs.debian.org/mr).
