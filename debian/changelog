mr (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Removed special case repository deletion handling code. The same
    thing can be accomplished in a mrconfig by skipping a repo unless
    it exists, and printing a reminder on update. See the mrconfig file
    for an example.
  * Fix output of "mr config DEFAULT lib".
  * Change mr update to use git pull -t origin master, to make sure new tags
    are pulled. And since those might not always be the right parameters
    for git pull, any parameters passed to mr update will replace them.

  [ Alexander Wirt ]
  * Add support for mercurial.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Incorporate code based on Anthony Towns's mrs, to allow running
    multiple jobs in parallel. The -j flag controls this.
    This can produce enormous speedups. For me, mr update takes
    12 minutes, while mr -j 10 update takes 1 minute!

mr (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix mr register of a subdir to also work with -c.
  * Signal handling for commands run by mr, including handling of SIGINT
    to stop mr.
  * Ensure parent dirs exist prior to checkout. (madduck)
  * Output list of failed repos to stderr when -s is used.
  * Fix a bug caused by a stupid typo.
  * Add the -n switch, for disabling recursion.
  * Allow for more complex deleted tests, such as marking a repo deleted on
    some hosts, while not on others.
  * Support registering CVS repositories. Closes: #447171
  * MR_CONFIG now points to the config file that contains the repo mr is
    acting on.
  * Make mr register smarter about what mrconfig file to write to.
    (It probably does what you'd expect it to do now; if it doesn't, -c
    can still override.)

mr (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a check to make sure the expected directory exists after checkout.

mr (0.2) unstable; urgency=low
