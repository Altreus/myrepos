mr is intended to be very self-contained, since it might be useful to check
it into ~/bin when keeping your home in version control. It has no
dependencies aside from basic perl.

Just copy mr into your PATH somewhere, if it isn't already, and set up
~/.mrconfig

----

webcheckout has more dependencies, specifically the LWP::Simple and
HTML::Parser CPAN modules, and optionally the URI module.
