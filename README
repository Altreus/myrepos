mr is intended to be very self-contained, since it might be useful to check
it into ~/bin when keeping your home in version control. It has no
dependencies aside from basic perl. (The included webcheckout command has
more dependencies, specifically the LWP::Simple and HTML::Parser CPAN
modules, and optionally the URI module.)

To install mr, just copy mr into your PATH somewhere.

To get started using mr, perhaps you already have some checked out
repositories. Go into each one and run "mr register". Now mr has
a list of them in ~/.mrconfig, which you can edit later to tune its
operation.

Suppose you've cd'd to ~/src, and it has many repositories under it.
To update them all, run "mr update". To commit any pending changes in
each, run "mr commit". To check the status of each, you could run
"mr status".

For further details, and lots of configuration options, see the mr(1) man
page.
